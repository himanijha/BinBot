## Github Commands

in your terminal

git status (see all files you have modified and will be “staged” for commit) \
git add . (the period specifies to add all files; you can specify specific files if you’d like) \
git commit -m “message stating your changes here” \
git push (pushes local onto origin) \

(for your first branch, copy the command that git tells you to do as well and run that) \

now, you can go onto GitHub and create a pull request— follow instructions there \

I will review and then you can merge. \ 

Once someone has merged, the other should run \
git pull \
